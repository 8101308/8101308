    <h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
    <p>
      As technology, both hardware and software, has progressed, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an increasingly popular topic of conversation. In short, the IoT includes any and all standalone devices that can be controlled and/or monitored from an external location is an IoT thing. “Simply put, this is the concept of basically connecting any device with an on and off switch to the Internet” (Morgan, 2014). But there is much more to it. So, what exactly is the Internet of Things and what are the social and ethical implications of the IoT’s security and transparency.
    </p>

    <h2>Function of the IoT</h2>
    <p>
      The Internet of Things can be seen all around us. It is the connection that a very large amount of technological “things” have with each other. These things include devices such as your smartphone, your car, or in some cases, your refrigerator. For these items (or any item in general) to function as a part of the IoT, they must have two specific abilities. These two abilities are, the ability to sense and the ability to communicate. For example, sensors can be identified in objects such as your smartphone. Your smartphone can do many things such as, detecting where you are, the words you are speaking, which direction you are holding it, or how far away it is from your face. That is only a small example of what a smart phone is capable of. The second ability is communication. Communication is essential to a device connecting to the IoT. It allows a piece of hardware to send and receive useful data to help the IoT grow and learn. A large number of devices have the ability to communicate with other devices. This includes things such as your car which can send updates about the car’s functionality live to a manufacturer. This same can also be said about devices as odd or unexpected as some refrigerators which have the ability to allow the users to do online shopping from the refrigerator itself (Samsung, 2018). The ability to sense and communicate are vital to the growth and support of the IoT as they help connect devices from all over the world. The role of the IoT is a simple one. It aims to grow, learn, and help users on a daily basis by constantly collecting data and sharing information throughout the world on a wireless network. This wireless network will greatly help us in the future by providing us the data and information that we will need at any time in any place.

    <h2>Role of the IoT</h2>
    <p>
      In the modern age, common household technologies have gained the ability to communicate and involve themselves with the IoT. This means that more and more items in our daily lives now have the ability to track and record data about our own lives using their sensors and communicative abilities. For instance, some of our watches and wrist bands have knowledge of how far we run in one day, or by using a “3-axis accelerometer to understand your motions” (Fitbit inc., 2018), they can count our steps, and deduce how many calories we have burned, where we have been, or how long we have slept. This information can all be sent through the IoT meaning it could cause a big issue as to how transparent we appear. This means that the data that our devices have collected on us can easily make its way into other people’s hands.

    <h2>Social and Ethical Implications of Security in the Internet of Things</h2>
    <p>
      Often, people will hear stories of large companies such as Google or Facebook selling their users’ personal data to external marketing companies. This isn’t necessarily true. In most cases, such as Google, companies do not sell your data but instead use it to collect more information about yourself which they can then use to expose you to more relevant adds (Google, 2018). However, in some cases, your data can be sold to external trade companies. These external companies, while they    seemingly have malicious intent, are often simple trades companies. For example, now that your personal data on how often you run each day has made it out onto the IoT, you might suddenly notice more adds that relate to that specific data. This means more exposure to products such as water bottles or sweatbands, things that a runner might be interested in, someone who might wear a Fitbit. In short, these devices are able to gather information about you and put it out onto the IoT which can be a challenge to the ethical implications of privacy. Is it ok to use a person’s information to attract them towards your own product?
    </p>
    <p>
      As said before, Google is known to tailor their adds towards your personal searches. They do this by recording your searches (evidence for this can be seen in the form of your search history) so that they are able to present you with advertisements that best suit you. For example, if you were to use google to search for a topic such as “computers”, you would be presented with adds that relate to computers. Google is also able to use the sensors in your phone or PC to locate where you are (geolocation), meaning they can present you with adds from businesses or companies that you are closer to. Often the phrase “If it’s out there, it can’t come down.” Is used to help with cyber security, and in some cases it is completely true. If the website has access (meaning you are signed in or have directly given the website permission), then that website “forgets nothing.” (Sullivan, 2009).

    <p>
      The Internet of Things, as previously stated, connects billions of devices around the world meaning that these devices can be found all throughout homes, workspaces, and even in public. Because these devices are so common, it means that they are more vulnerable to external users gaining unauthorized access, or hacking. This is a major flaw in the security of the IoT. These security issues pose a threat to the social and ethical use of the IoT and a threat to the users of the IoT. Now that the IoT has grown to such a large scale where so many devices and so many people are connected, hacking has become a threat to the new, larger, and more susceptible Internet of Things. Hackers are now able, using the huge amount of technologies connected to the IoT, gain access to private systems such as traffic lights (Lee, 2016) through unordinary means with little to no effort. This means that because susceptible devices such as your fridge or even your lightbulb are connected to your home computer, hackers are able to use these other devices as a gateway into your computer or your phone. A normal home refrigerator that is connected to the IoT, does not contain antivirus software. Your home firewall now has a “hole” in it because of these other devices. Mike Armistead, the Vice President of HP (2014), further supports this statement, “With the continued adoption of connected devices, it is more important than ever to build security into these products from the beginning to disrupt the adversary and avoid exposing consumers to serious threats.” The security of the internet of things is extremely breachable because of the size of it. To help prevent security threats, it is important to introduce firewalls to most devices connected to the IoT.

    <h2>Social and Ethical Implications of transparency in the Internet of Things</h2>
    <p>
      The social implications of the Internet of Things come in the form of how people are able to connect to each other. This connection can be seen through messaging, calling, or even liking a post on social media. The IoT is made possible because of the ability that everyone has to connect with each other. This also majorly affects one’s transparency online. As said before, the IoT is constantly recording data. Because this data often makes its way onto the cloud or the world wide web, it becomes very easy to find information on anyone. This also affects the ethical side as hackers are able to gain access to even more privatised data as so much of it is held by the IoT. A simple example of this could be, the data gathered by your smart wrist band. Many bands will track your sleeping habits. Suddenly, this small part of your life is recorded and stored on the IoT for anyone to gain unauthorized access into and take, sell, or use.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Internet of Things is the connection of devices from all around the world. These connected devices have the ability to sense and communicate, meaning they can record data and share it with any other devices on the IoT. Because the IoT is so large, it poses many threats in terms of security and transparency. This includes hacking and data breaching. Although there are many downfalls to the IoT, there are also a lot of advantages such as having the ability to collect useful data. The Internet of Things can be found all throughout the world and is only looking to grow.
